## Food Prediction Application

This is the final project for course 05-618: Human-AI Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. My name is Will Scott, and I'm in Section B for the Spring 2025 semester.
For the final assignment, I created a real-time food prediction application that determines the type of food you're consuming based on microphone audio. 

Since this application is written entirely in Swift with their CoreML framework, you will need the latest version of Xcode installed, 16.3, at the time of writing this. Additionally,
due to Apple's strict developer rules, you will need a valid Apple ID along with an iPhone, connected via cable, to deploy the compiled application onto a device after building. 
Furthermore, the associated deployment device must first have developer settings enabled and second, approve the Apple ID account associated with the laptop 
underneath the Security & Vpn setting directory. 

The steps to reproduce are below. 
1. Install XCode from Online.
2. Clone this git repository.
3. Navigate to the dev-FoodPrediction2 branch through the terminal or GitHub Desktop application.
  3a. `git checkout dev-FoodPrediction2`

4. Open the `ContentView` file underneath the `Eating Activity Prototype` subdirectory.
5. Select the deployment device connected to the developer laptop from the center status bar, located at the top of the Xcode.
6. Build the project to deploy the application! You're done!
